# A-Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor
This is a public repository for a pipelined RISC-V processor capable of executing bubble sort. The processor consists of a 64 bit ALU with the necessary forwarding circuitry, hazard detection unit, and pipeline flushing to detect control and data hazards in the program. All file names are self explanatory. Change the instructions memory file to change the program to be executed. The processor is designed on Verilog and was simulated on ModelSim. The processor is capable of running the following instructions: Add, sub, addi, beq, blt, or, and, sd, ld.
