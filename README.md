# A-Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor
This is a public repository for a pipelined RISC-V processor capable of executing bubble sort on it. The processor consists of a 64 bit ALU with all the the forwarding circuitry, hazard detection unit, and pipeline flushing to detect control and data hazards in the program.
